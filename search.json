To make a callout collapsible, use collapse=\"true\" as in the example below. This places a dropdown icon to the right of the title bar, which controls expansion.\n::: { .callout-caution collapse=\"true\" title=\"Caution (click to expand)\"}\nThis is a collapsible caution block. The callout content goes here.\n:::\nNotice also that the title of the callout is specified between the curly braces as title=\"Caution (click to expand)\".\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about callout blocks in the Quarto documentation.",
