For example, the `R` code cell below executes and produces output when the book is compiled:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the `R` code cell below does not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.",
