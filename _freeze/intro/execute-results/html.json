    "markdown": "# Introduction\n\nThe Introduction page is intended as a short introduction to the book.\n\nLike most Quarto books, this is a book created from markdown and executable code. \n\nThis kind of book is an example of literate programming - the intertwining of nicely-formatted text and images, and executable code. For example, the `R` code cell below executes and produces output when the book is compiled:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut the `R` code cell below does not:\n\n```r\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nSee @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.",
