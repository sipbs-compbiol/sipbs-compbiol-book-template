# How do I…?

This page is intended as a FAQ/HowTo for some common questions that might come up when using this template for the first time.

Some [example pages](example_pages.qmd) dedicated to common tasks and specific kinds of presentation are included later in the template.

## …create a new page?

::: { .callout-tip title="tl;dr" }
1. Create a new plant text file
2. Write Markdown content in your file
3. Save your file as a `.qmd` file (with an appropriate filename)
4. Add your filename to the `_quarto.yml` file in an appropriate place
5. Commit your changes
6. Push the changes to your repository
:::

Assuming that you're using `RStudio`, you need to create a new file to hold the Markdown for your page. I usually create a new text file (`File -> New File -> Text File` or click on the `New File` icon and select `Text File`). Write some content in the file and save it as a `.qmd` file with a meaningful filename (e.g. this file is called `howto.qmd`).

At this point, the file you just wrote could be rendered, but it won't be linked as a page in the book. To link the file, open the `_quarto.yml` file and look for the section that starts:

```yaml
# Define chapters and sections here
  # [E] CHAPTERS AND SECTIONS
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
```

Then enter the name of your file in the appropriate place, e.g. in the `early-section.qmd` part, as a chapter following `tutorial.qmd` in the example below:

```yaml
    - part: early-section.qmd
      chapters: 
        - tutorial.qmd
        - howto.qmd      # new page added at this line
```

::: { .callout-warning }
The `_quarto.yml` file is written in a language called `YAML` (yet another markup language), and the syntax is important. If you follow the style of the file, you should be fine.
:::

and then render the file.

::: { .callout-important }
To ensure your changes are not lost, _commit_ the changes to your repository (your `.qmd` file, the `_quarto.yml` file, and any supporting images or other files), and _push_ them to GitHub.
