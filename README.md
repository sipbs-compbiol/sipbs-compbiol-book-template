# README.md sipbs-compbiol-book-template

This repository is a template, intended as a convenience to take some manual work out of setting the style for Quarto books used by SIPBS Computational Biology.

This version of the template includes:

- a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) that should update the GitHub Pages version of the book on each push to the `main` branch.
- an example WebR page
